# Today I Learned

Write **1–3 concrete things** you understood better today.

- What _clicked_ today?
- What changed in your understanding?
- What would you explain differently now?

- test should conver all lines of your code.
- we can convert file into stream
- generally parse should do peak and shift

# Still Confusing

List **up to 3 things** that are still unclear.

- What almost makes sense but doesn’t fully?
- What would you like to see one more example of?
- What feels fragile in your understanding?

- how to convert a file into stream (need to practice)

# Questions to Chase

Write **2–5 questions** worth pursuing later.

Rules:

- Questions must be specific
- Avoid yes/no questions

- “Why does X behave differently when Y?”
- “What breaks if I remove Z?”
- “How does this scale / fail / degrade?”

---

# Tiny Experiments (Optional)

Small things you want to try tomorrow or later.

- A REPL experiment
- A minimal snippet
- A variation of today’s code

- (today) try to rewrite whole head with streams
