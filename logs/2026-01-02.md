# Today I Learned

Write **1–3 concrete things** you understood better today.

- What _clicked_ today? -Effect of small change in final result,
- What changed in your understanding? -Importance of math (vectors, translation,
  rotation) -It's not about the final result it's about the process or the steps
  which leads us to the final result. -If you have a good code structure by
  changing a small value you can achive a good result.
- What would you explain differently now? -Concepts of math with visual
  representation

# Still Confusing

List **up to 3 things** that are still unclear.

- What almost makes sense but doesn’t fully? -Concepts like rotation, vectors
- What would you like to see one more example of? -Process data with vectors
- What feels fragile in your understanding? -vectors with angle, is it just take
  some coordinate and move it into a certain angle

# Questions to Chase

Write **2–5 questions** worth pursuing later.

Rules:

- Questions must be specific
- Avoid yes/no questions

- “Why does X behave differently when Y?”
- “What breaks if I remove Z?”
- “How does this scale / fail / degrade?”

- p5 animations are smoother than the terminal, it's may be because of canvus
  but what makes canvus smooth but not terminal ?

# Tiny Experiments (Optional)

Small things you want to try tomorrow or later.

- A REPL experiment
- A minimal snippet
- A variation of today’s code

## Simulate the L system in p5 js

# One-Sentence Summary

Finish this sentence:

> Today was useful because showed my ppm image decoder and pokedex to others,
> they ask question about how am I displaying image in terminal that question
> leads me to explain some topic so it's helpfull for me to remeber and
> understand more about the topics Also got some extra motivation for p5js
