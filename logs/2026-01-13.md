# Today I Learned

Write **1–3 concrete things** you understood better today.

- What _clicked_ today?
- What changed in your understanding?
- What would you explain differently now?

- learn more about dependency injection
- how does a terminal works

# Still Confusing

List **up to 3 things** that are still unclear.

- What almost makes sense but doesn’t fully?
- What would you like to see one more example of?
- What feels fragile in your understanding?

# Questions to Chase

Write **2–5 questions** worth pursuing later.

Rules:

- Questions must be specific
- Avoid yes/no questions

- “Why does X behave differently when Y?”
- “What breaks if I remove Z?”
- “How does this scale / fail / degrade?”

# Tiny Experiments (Optional)

Small things you want to try tomorrow or later.

- A REPL experiment
- A minimal snippet
- A variation of today’s code

- now for testing sny implementation of shell command we are writing the
  expected output manually, so is there any way to directly running a command in
  terminal through deno and get the output as expected output
- making a visualizer for async await
